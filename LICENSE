SECURITY WARNING:

The Anviz protocol transmits data in plaintext over TCP/IP. This implementation
does not add encryption or authentication beyond what the protocol provides.
For production use:

1. Use VPN or encrypted tunnel (IPSec, SSH, etc.)
2. Implement network segmentation
3. Use firewall rules to restrict device access
4. Monitor for CVE-2019-12393 (replay attack vulnerability)
